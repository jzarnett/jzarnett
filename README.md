### Hello There!

Introducing myself is hard. I never know what to say. It's hard for me to talk about myself without feeling like I'm bragging. Or, for less technically-inclined people, boring you with the story of the time I redirected the warp plasma flow to the main deflector dish to generate a subspace shockwave to defeat the Klingons. 

### What do I do?
If I have to give myself a concise summary of my core skills: I tell computers what to do, and teach other people how to get better at doing that.

### Sprechen Sie Deutsch? Parlez-vous franÃ§ais? Snakker du Dansk? Fala PortuguÃªs?
I speak English and German well. My French is rusty but not terrible. I working on Danish for a bit, but now it's Portguese.
